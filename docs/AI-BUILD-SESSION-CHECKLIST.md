# AI Build Session Checklist

> **Purpose:** Lean handoff document. Update the Hand-Off section at the end of every session.
> **Rule:** Keep this file under 200 lines. Move completed session details to `docs/archive/sessions/`.

## Hand-Off from Last Session

**Date:** 2026-02-15
**Session:** Fix Label Auto-Fill Data Fetching (Critical Bug)
**Status:** ✅ Complete

**What was done:**
- Fixed `getCompleteLabelDataForPackage()` in `labelAutoFill.service.ts` -- was completely broken
- Root cause: invalid Supabase embedded joins (no FK between inventory_items and certificates_of_analysis; wrong table names `batches` and `strain_catalog`; nonexistent `lab_name` column on COA)
- Rewrote to sequential queries: inventory_items -> certificates_of_analysis (via batch_id) -> batch_registry -> strains -> products (by name match)
- Added explicit COA validation (GAP-007 safety net): throws descriptive error if no active COA for batch
- Fixed harvest_date source: batch_registry first, then COA fallback

**Build status:** ✅ Passes (2484.48 kB)

**Known issues:** None active

**Next recommendations:**
1. Test label auto-fill end-to-end with a real package assignment workflow
2. Test physical label printing with actual label printers (currently optimized for 2"x3" labels)
3. Consider adding QR code generation for labels (infrastructure exists, needs integration)
4. Add label template customization (different sizes, layouts)
