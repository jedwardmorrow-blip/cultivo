# AI Build Session Checklist

> **Purpose:** Lean handoff document. Update the Hand-Off section at the end of every session.
> **Rule:** Keep this file under 200 lines. Move completed session details to `docs/archive/sessions/`.

## Hand-Off from Last Session

**Date:** 2026-02-19
**Session:** D-6 — Cultivation Module Health Analysis + Bug Fix
**Status:** COMPLETE

**What was done:**
- Ran full in-depth analysis of the cultivation module (code, docs, DB, routing, navigation, compatibility)
- **Key finding:** D-2 migration (`dry_rooms` + `binning_sessions` tables) is **already live** in the database — the architecture doc had it marked as "PENDING MIGRATION" incorrectly. Both tables exist with correct schema, RLS, and triggers.
- **Bug fixed:** `listUnbinnedHarvestSessions` in `cultivation.service.ts` had a UUID array formatting bug — Supabase `.not('id', 'in', ...)` requires UUIDs quoted inside the parentheses string (`("uuid1","uuid2")`), not bare-joined (`uuid1,uuid2`). Fixed.
- Updated `CULTIVATION-ARCHITECTURE.md`: corrected D-2 migration status from PENDING to COMPLETE, updated document header and version history, added Health Analysis section
- Updated `AI-BUILD-SESSION-CHECKLIST.md` (this file) with new hand-off

**Build status:** PASSES — 308/308 tests pass

**Known issues (carry-forward, unchanged):**
- Pre-existing tsc errors — not blocking

**Modified files (this session):**
- `src/features/cultivation/services/cultivation.service.ts` — UUID array format fix in `listUnbinnedHarvestSessions`
- `docs/CULTIVATION-ARCHITECTURE.md` — D-2 status corrected, health analysis section added, version bumped to v1.8
- `docs/AI-BUILD-SESSION-CHECKLIST.md` (this file)
- `CHANGELOG.md`

**Next recommendations (in order):**
1. **Module status update** — update `docs/MODULE-STATUS.md` cultivation entry from "pending" to "complete" — the module is functionally complete
2. **Integration UX bridge** — add a "View Batch" link from completed harvest sessions to the Batches module (Cultivation → Batches linkage gap identified in analysis)
3. **Integration tests** — cultivation trigger behavior (stage machine, batch creation, binning validation) is the highest-value future test target if live DB test infrastructure is added
