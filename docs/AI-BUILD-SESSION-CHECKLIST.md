## Hand-Off from Last Session

**Date:** 2026-02-28
**Session:** Inventory Row Actions — Quick Adjust, Rebalance Weight, Combine Packages
**Status:** COMPLETE

**What was done:**

Added a three-dot row action menu to the All Inventory table with three per-item operations. Database RPCs were applied in a prior session; this session built all frontend code.

**1. RowActionMenu component** (new)
- `RowActionMenu.tsx` — Reusable three-dot dropdown with visibility toggles, destructive styling, click-outside/Escape dismissal.

**2. Quick Adjustment restyle** (rewrite)
- `QuickAdjustmentModal.tsx` — Full dark theme restyle (cult-* colors). Variance display: emerald for increases, red for decreases. 5%+ high variance warning.

**3. Rebalance Weight feature** (new)
- `rebalance.types.ts` — RebalanceRequest, RebalanceResult, RebalanceValidation interfaces
- `rebalance.service.ts` — validateRebalance() client-side checks + executeRebalance() calls `fn_rebalance_inventory_weight` RPC
- `RebalanceWeightModal.tsx` — Searchable destination picker, live before/after preview, 50%+ warning, reason + notes fields

**4. AllInventoryView wiring** (modified)
- Replaced inline printer column with RowActionMenu (Print Label, Adjust Qty [admin], Rebalance [admin])
- Added QuickAdjustmentModal and RebalanceWeightModal with full state management
- Data refresh on completion of any action

**5. Bug fix: useAdjustment hook**
- Fixed broken import `AdjustmentRequest` -> `QuickAdjustmentRequest`
- Added userId passthrough to adjustment service

**6. InventoryTable enhancement**
- Added `renderRowActions` prop with proper colspan accounting

**Build status:** PASSES
**Known issues (carry-forward, unchanged):**
- Pre-existing tsc errors — not blocking
- `customer_price_lists` RLS uses `USING (true)` — pre-existing, not changed this session

**Next recommendations (in order):**
1. **Sales rep performance dashboard** — Per-rep metrics, deal tracking, quota progress
2. **Export/reporting capabilities** — Account data export, revenue reports
3. **Cultivation: Move to Group action** — plant-level workflow with strain validation
4. **Cultivation: Move to Room action** — split plants into new group in different room
